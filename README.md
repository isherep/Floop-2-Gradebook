Goal: Teachers need a way to view grades and other submission details for all students in a class on a single page. The client was looking to rewrite part of their website to React and as well implement a new feature Gradebook, that allows teachers to track individual student engagement. 

This project required interaction with Firebase non-relational database in the back-end and transition of Floop website to newer faster technologies such as React, Redux, and Firebase. 

Our group worked on creating a gradebook feature for teachers, that allows tracking students grades, feedback response, discussions engagements, submissions status over time all in one page. Used Firebase (Cloud Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Auth) and Node.js as our backend, React.js as a front end UI.

The Gradebook allows tracking progress by assignment and by the metric. In the View by assignment, the teachers can interchange between submission statuses, grades, and the feedback students receive and their response engagement to the feedback. 

In the View by metric, the teacher can track grades, engagement, and submissions for each assignment; that way track these metric per each assignment.
