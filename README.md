Goal: Teachers need a way to view grades and other submission details for all students in a class on a single page. This project requires interaction with our back-end They also were looking to transition their website to newer faster technologies such as React, Redux and Firebase. The client was looking to rewrite part of their website in React and as well implement a new feature Gradebook, that allows teachers track individual student engagement. Our group worked on creating a gradebook feature for the teachers, that allows tracking students grades, feedback response, discussions engagements,  submissions status over time. I worked on the backend part of the project, connecting non-relational database Firebase student data to it and making sure the data in the webpage gets updated smoothly with the database. Used We use Firebase (Cloud Firestore, Cloud Functions, and Auth) as our backend
